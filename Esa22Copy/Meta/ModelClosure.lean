Machine-checks the audit surface: the statement of the headline theorem must
unfold only to constants defined under `Esa22Copy/Model/`.

This is tooling, hence proof content, hence deliberately *outside* the surface
it checks.

Seeding from a theorem's **type** rather than its value is the crux: the proof
may use anything, and routinely should. Only the statement is constrained.
